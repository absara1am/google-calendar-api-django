# Google Calendar Integration
This project provides a Django web application that integrates with the Google Calendar API, allowing users to authenticate and retrieve a list of events from their Google Calendar. The application follows the OAuth2 authorization flow to obtain access tokens and make requests to the Google Calendar API.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.x)
Django (version 3.x)
Required libraries: google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-api-python-client

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
Navigate to the project folder 'google_calendar_integration'.

## Setting up the virtual environment
Create a virtual environment named '.venv' by running the appropriate command for your operating system:
Windows: 'py -3 -m venv .venv'

Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: '.venv\scripts\activate'

## Installing dependencies
Upgrade pip to the latest version:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setting up environment variables
Set the environment variables 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' and 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET' with the corresponding values of your Google Cloud project's client ID and client secret. These variables are used for OAuth2 authentication.

## Database migration
Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
Copy code
python manage.py migrate

## Running the application
Start the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver

Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/v1/calendar/init/. This URL initiates the authentication process with Google.

Grant access to the Google Calendar integration by logging in with a Google account associated with the authorized test users specified in your Google Cloud project.

After successful authentication, you should be able to see a list of events from your Google Calendar on the webpage.
